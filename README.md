# My local Build Battle (?)

So the other day I was chatting with some friends and we got a bit nostalgic talking about playing Minecraft online modes in the past, one of our favourites was Build Battle and we thought about playing it again by ourselves. So I pulled out to my living room, because nowadays we play on console, and we started looking for random prompts & ideas to build & compete.

It was amazingly funny, we definitely wanted to do it again, but it is true that we had kinda of a rought time deciding what to create... So I thought about making an "idea generator" to build these 3D models.

Basically I wrote like +250 strings in an array & made a simple HTML page to pick five random options. To be honest, I'm making this repository to basically have a free domain to access this thing without opening Visual Studio haha. Maybe someone else find this funny.

In the 'Rules' page, I also defined some concepts to not only play Build Battle inside of Minecraft, but also for making actual 3D models in case the competitors are artists & designers :D. In case you don't want to set a 5 minutes timer yourself, open the 'Timer' page and you'll find one.

Try it out live on [this link](https://mupgarlic.github.io/local-build-battle/) or by just downloading this ZIP.
